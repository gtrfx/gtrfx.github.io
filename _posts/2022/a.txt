The DL/UL simulator supports single BWP which occupies all the grid.

The typical bandwidth and SCS combinations that the current simulator supports are 
- 25 MHz BW with 15kHz SCS
- 100MHz with 30kHz SCS

Physical channels that the current downlink simulator supports are
SSB/PDCCH/PDSCH. 

SSB supports all the possible configuration in the specification
For PDCCH, the simulator supports up to 3 CORESETS

for PDSCH, it supports up to 8 layer transmission

Currently CSI-RS is not being supported.

The uplink simulator supports 
PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH and SRS

Currently UL transmitter supports all the possible configurations for UL TX.
Receiver has some limitations in features now.

- PRACH detector supports preamble format 0 and B4
- PUCCH supports PUCCH format 0, 1, 2 and 3
- PUSCH support 2 and 4 receive antennas

The simulator was built for 64 bit linux and windows.
The released package includes shared objects and DLL which are needed for its execution.
