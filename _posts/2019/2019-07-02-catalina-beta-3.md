Catalina beta 3 still supports only one music library (mostly local library). That means I can't use my own daap server that I've been using so far.

Adding an (MS) Exchange account is still a big headache.

It is still reporting lots of "Crash reports" unnoticed by users like a submarine. But it causes some CPU loads, so my CPU fan lets me know it.
