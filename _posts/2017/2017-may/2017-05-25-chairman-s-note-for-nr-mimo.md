* FFS Condition 2: Beam failure is detected alone at least for the case of no reciprocity
* FFS how the recovery request is transmitted without knowledge of candidate beam
* Note: if both conditions are supported, which triggering condition to use by UE also depends on both gNB configuration and UE capability

R1-1709379	WF on Frequency hopping for SRS	Ericsson, Sony, Mitsubishi Electric

**Conclusion:**

* RAN1 is discussing the possibility of enabling SRS hopping within a slot. For an X-port SRS resource spanning N adjacent OFDM symbols within the same slot, all X ports may be sounded as frequently as up to each of the N symbols in a different portion of the band. In addition to other aspects that need to be investigated in RAN1, RAN1 is also wondering UE RF implementation aspects that may place constraints on the design (e.g., total SRS hopping bandwidth) of the hopping pattern, e.g., required time for frequency re-tuning (if re-tuning needed) or transient period if re-tuning is not needed. Note that RAN1 also made an agreement as follows (Mattias to copy previous agreements on SRS switching across bandwidth parts)
