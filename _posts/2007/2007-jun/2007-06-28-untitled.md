지금은 Ericsson의 Dirk Gerstenberger가 RAN1 의장을 맡고 있는데 8월 회의에서 새로운 의장과 부의장이 선출될 모양이다. 

과연 어느 회사의 누가 될까..?
-------------------------------------
Good morning all,
An election for Chairman and two Vice Chairman of 3GPP TSG RAN WG 1 (Radio Layer 1) will be held during the RAN WG1meeting #50, 20 to 24 August 2007 in Athens, Greece. 

Candidatures are now invited for these positions. 
Candidatures should be accompanied by a brief CV and a letter of support from the hiring company and should indicate to which Individual Member and Partner they belong. 

Candidatures for this position should be addressed to the Mobile Competence Centre for the attention of Patrick Merias and Susanna Kooistra and should ideally be received by Monday 13 August 2007.

A list of the candidatures received will be posted on the 3GPP web site. (Candidatures may be received up to the time when the election takes place but for practical reasons Individual Members are asked to respect the deadline given above where possible). 

Best regards,
Susanna Kooistra
MCC support team
