Hi Guys

I've been thinking how to do this - so this is the first "Test posting"
Please respond with ideas to make this easier to understand, or (moderator) if the pics are taking up too much space on your server.
This is the Jamez Guitar EQs for Battery rtm gtrs. 
The Amp is Jamex Boogie into 2 Marshal cabs. Inserted in the loop on the amp,
is a B&amp;B Audio (Aphex) parametric EQ EQF-1 as show on the left side of the pic.

The mics used are:

1 SM57 Shure in the center of the cone on one of the lower speakers.
1 B&amp;K (DPA) 4006 omni on another speaker centercone.
1 AKG gold-tube in a 45 degree angle to the sideedge of the cab. aprox 4 feet away.

Miking is identical for both cabs.

The settings on the top is the amp settings including the Graf EQ on the Amp.
Mid Right is the EQF-1 loop eq settings.
Bottom is the EQ on the Desk a Trident A-range. 
far left SM 57 it means
5K=-2 10K=+3, 150hz=+9, 1K=-3, 50hz lowcut(hipass) Fader=-10.

Hope this is understandable.

Enjoy

Flemming Rasmussen
