And the third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. And then It came to pass that all the wine was drunk. The mother of Jesus said unto the lord, "They have no more wine". Jesus said unto the servants "Fill six water pots with water!", and they did so. When the steward of the feast did taste the water from the pots. It had become wine. And they knew not whence it had come.

But the servants did know, and they applauded loudly in the kitchen. and they said unto the lord "How the hell did you do that?", and inquired of him, "Do you do children's parties?" And the lord said, "No." But the servants did pressing him, "Go on, give us another one!"

So, he brought forth a carrot, and said "Behold this, for it is a carrot,"All about him knew it was so, For it was orange with a green top. And he did place a large cloth over the carrot, and then removed it. And lo he held in his hand a white rabbit! And all were amazed, and said "This guy is really good! He should turn professional!"

And they brought him on a stretcher a man sick of the palsy, and they cried unto him, "Maestro, this man is sick of the palsy."
And the lord said "If I had to spend my whole life on a stretcher, I'd be pretty sick of the palsy, too!" And they were filled with joy, and cried "Thy one liners is as good as thy tricks! Thou art indeed all round family entertainer!"

And there came to a woman called Mary who had seen the Lord and believed. Jesus said unto the woman, "Put on a tutu, and lie down in this box." and then took he forth a sword, and cleft her in twain. And there was much whaling and gnashing of teeth. 
But Jesus said "Oh, Ye of little faith!", and threw off his box, and there was Mary as a whole. And the crowd went absolutely bananas. And Jesus and Mary took a big vow, and he said unto her "From now on you shall be known as Sharon,For that is a good name for an assistant." And the people said "We've never seen like this. This is great. You must be the son of God."

Here ends the lesson.
