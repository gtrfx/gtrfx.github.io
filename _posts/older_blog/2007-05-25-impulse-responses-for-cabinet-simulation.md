# Impulse Responses for Cabinet Simulation..

Here are 6 impulse responses (32 bit-floating point, wave format) for your home studio recording.

- Axetrak (normal, lite(less bass))
- MesaCabinet #1 (normal, lite(less bass))
- MesaCabinet #2 (normal, lite(less bass))

Get your preamp output when recording, and apply RTAS/VST (semi) real-time convolver using these impulse responses.

Enjoy!
